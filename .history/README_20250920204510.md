## ‚ú® Project Case Study: From Tutorial to Custom Solution

This project is my personal implementation of the AI Resume Analyzer, originally based on a tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. I've used this opportunity not just to follow along, but to build upon the foundation by integrating a custom AI model and refining the system's core logic. 

üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThis README documents my learning journey, the technical architecture, and the personal enhancements I made to elevate the project.

### üéØ Motivation & Goals

As a capstone project, my primary goal is to be selected for a company visit to the IBM office. 

This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to solve complex problems and build practical, end-to-end AI applications using modern, efficient tools.

### üöÄ My Learning Journey: From Challenge to Solution

My development path has been a journey of continuous learning. 
Previously, I attempted to build a complex full-stack Jira clone, which I struggled to complete due to the sheer complexity of the setup. 

üóùÔ∏èThis ResumeZ project was a completely different experience.

The key difference was discovering **Puter.js** and **Zustand**. Puter.js's serverless architecture eliminated the backend complexities that had stalled me before, while Zustand provided an incredibly simple and intuitive way to manage state. This allowed me to focus on the application logic and user experience rather than boilerplate. 

üêçMy background in ML fundamentals (Python, Jupyter) and previous full-stack experience allowed me to quickly grasp the high-level system architecture, and this project was the perfect opportunity to dive deep into the implementation details and solidify my understanding.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive: The AI Workflow

This application demonstrates a complete, practical AI workflow from data ingestion to analysis and output. I architected the flow in five critical steps:

1.  **User Authentication:** Secure, client-side login is handled seamlessly by Puter.js, requiring no backend setup.
2.  **Data Ingestion:** The user uploads their resume (PDF/DOCX), which is securely stored.
3.  **AI Processing & Enhancement:** The core logic was modified to call the **IBM Granite-3.3-8b-Instruction model** via the **Replicate API**. My custom-engineered system prompt instructs the model to analyze the resume content against the provided job description.
4.  **Analysis & Output:** The model returns a detailed ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score and provides actionable, structured feedback to help the user improve their resume.
5.  **State Management:** **Zustand** is used to efficiently manage the global application state (like user data and analysis results) with minimal code and maximum performance.

### üí° Beyond the Tutorial: My Personal Enhancements

To take this project beyond the original tutorial, I implemented several key modifications:

* **Custom Branding:** I redesigned the hero section and updated the terminology to create a unique identity for the application, now named "ResumeZ."
* **Adapted Core Function:** I replaced the default prompt with generated system-prompt by **IBM's Granite-3.3-8b-Instruct model** , a powerful and efficient model known for its instruction-following capabilities.
* **Prompt Engineering:** I re-engineered the system prompt to be more robust and specific, leveraging my understanding of prompt design to elicit higher-quality, more consistent analysis from the IBM Granite model.

### üß† Reflection & Next Steps

This project was a significant milestone. It solidified my understanding of how AI is not just about training models, but about **skillfully integrating existing tools** and **architecting a functional data workflow** to solve a real-world business problem. 

üß≠The process of independently debugging and solving integration challenges‚Äîoften with the help of AI assistants‚Äîhas made me a more confident and resourceful developer.

Following this project, my focus is to deepen my foundational knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science, returning to core concepts to build an even stronger theoretical base for my future work as an AI Engineer.üí™
